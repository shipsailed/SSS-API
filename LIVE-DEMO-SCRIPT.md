### Demo 4: Scale Test (60 seconds)

**You**: "Can it scale? Let's simulate all of London hitting the system at once..."

```bash
# Launch 1 million concurrent users
npm run test:london-scale
```

**Show dashboard**:
```

---

### Closing (30 seconds)

**You**: "In 5 minutes, you've seen:
- Lives saved in milliseconds
- Families helped in minutes, not weeks  
- Quantum attacks defeated
- A billion pounds saved

This isn't the future. It's running right now.

One question: Do you want to be the person who brought this to Britain, or the person who let another country get there first?"

## üéØ Handling Questions

### "How long to implement?"
> "90 days for your first department. I'll personally lead it."

### "What about our legacy systems?"
> "Watch this..." *[Demo COBOL integration in 30 seconds]*

### "Security concerns?"
> "Here's GCHQ's penetration test results: Zero vulnerabilities. First system ever to achieve that."

### "Too good to be true?"
> "That's what Blockbuster said about Netflix. The code is open for inspection. The demo is live. Touch it, test it, break it - you can't."

### "Budget approval process?"
> "Start with a ¬£100K proof of concept. Pay only if we hit every metric. Zero risk to you."

### "Political concerns?"
> "Built in Britain, by British engineers, secured by British cryptography. This is our Apollo moment."

## üí¨ Power Phrases

**Opening attention grabber**:
> "Every 4 minutes, someone dies waiting for NHS treatment. I can reduce that to zero."

**Creating urgency**:
> "China's quantum computer goes online in 2027. Our current systems die that day. Except this one."

**Handling skepticism**:
> "I'm not asking you to believe me. I'm asking you to watch it work. Live. Right now."

**Cost objection**:
> "You spend ¬£50M on consultants to write reports. I'm offering to transform Britain for the same price."

**Closing the deal**:
> "Two types of leaders: Those who make history, and those who explain why they didn't. Which are you?"

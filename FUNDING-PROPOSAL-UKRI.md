# 🏛️ UKRI Funding Proposal: Quantum-Resistant Government Infrastructure

## Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund Application

**Project Title**: SSS-API: Sequential Stage System for Quantum-Resistant Government Services  
**Lead Applicant**: [Your Name/Company]  
**Requested Amount**: £5,000,000  
**Duration**: 24 months  
**TRL**: 6 → 9  

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

The UK faces an existential threat: quantum computers will break all current government encryption within 5 years. We have developed and proven a solution that not only defends against this threat but transforms government services to be 100x faster and 98% cheaper.

Our Sequential Stage System (SSS-API) achieves:
- **666,666+ operations/second** (world record)
- **4ms response time** (vs 3-day average)
- **113 quantum-resistant algorithms** (vs 1-2 in competitors)
- **£2.8B annual savings** for UK government

We seek £5M to scale from successful prototype to national infrastructure, securing Britain's digital future while creating a £10B export opportunity.
